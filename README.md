# XcodeIndexDecoder

Decode the Objective-C function call hierarchy from the index db generated by Xcode.

## caller.py

To get caller hierarchy for function (function_name) in project (stored in project_path), call the following:

    *#python caller project_path [function_name]*
  
The out put is a caller hierarchy tree, like the expanded call hierarchy in Xcode.


## callee.py

To get callees for function (function_name) in project (stored in project_path), call the following:

    *#python callee project_path [function_name]*
  
The output is a list of descendent functions of function_name, with their direct children following it (indented).

## Example:

    *#python caller.py ~/bsl/MyProject_4.5.0/ -[KeyboardViewController \loadMainView]*
  
    *#python callee.py ~/bsl/MyProject_4.5.0/ -[KeyboardViewController \loadMainView]*

## NOTE:

Because the tool matches the project_path string in the Info.plist stored in the derived data folder, you may just specify part of the project_path as convenience.

For example, you may specify MyProject_4.5.0 only instead of the full path, like the following:

    *#python callee.py MyProject_4.5.0 -[KeyboardViewController \loadMainView]*
  
But be ware that, if there are multiple projects containing the same partial name, the tool will use the first one it finds, which may not be the one you expect.
